Colas is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Cognitive Science Lab at MIT and the Flowers Lab at INRIA. His PhD thesis introduced the concept of autotelic learning: a computational framework for endowing artificial agents with the ability to represent and pursue their own goals. Through the co-evolution of goal generation and goal achievement systems, autotelic learning makes the first steps towards a computational model of humanâ€™s ability to grow repertoires of skills throughout a lifetime. His current research interests include the examination of the role of social interactions in shaping the goal representations and goal reaching skills of artificial agents.
