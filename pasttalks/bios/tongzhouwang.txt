Tongzhou is a final year PhD student at MIT, advised by Phillip Isola and Antonio Torralba. His research interests lie in structures in machine learning and artificial agents, focusing on learning structured representations for better perception and decision-making. His work spans representation learning, reinforcement learning, and machine learning. Tongzhou co-organized the Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023, bridging researchers and practitioners across machine learning and decision-making. Before his PhD study, Tongzhou received his bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley while working with Stuart Russell, Alyosha Efros and Ren Ng, and was an early member of the PyTorch team at Facebook AI Research.
