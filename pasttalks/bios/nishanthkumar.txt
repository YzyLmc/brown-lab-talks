Nishanth is a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the LIS Group at MIT CSAIL, where his research is supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship. He is primarily interested in enabling robots to operate robustly in long-horizon, multi-task settings so that they can accomplish tasks like multi-object manipulation, cooking, or even performing household chores. To this end, his work seeks to synthesize ideas from a number of sub-fields of AI, including Task and Motion Planning, Reinforcement Learning, Program Synthesis and Neurosymbolic methods. Previously, Nishanth obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Brown University, where he was a Goldwater Scholar, CRA Outstanding Undergrad Researcher Award Finalist, and was named the Outstanding Senior in Computer Engineering upon graduation.
