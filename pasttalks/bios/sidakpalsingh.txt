Sidak Pal Singh is a 4th year PhD student at ETH Zürich and Max Planck Insitute of Intelligent Systems, Tübingen advised by Thomas Hofmann and Bernhard Schölkopf. Before that, he obtained his Masters in Data Science at EPFL and Bachelor in Computer Science at the Indian Insitute of Technology Roorkee. Sidak's main research interests are in uncovering structural and functional properties of neural networks, with the larger aim of developing a better and more precise understanding of the remarkable generalization capabilities of neural networks. This includes, among other things, questions surrounding the loss landscape and its curvature, double descent behaviour of generalization, mode connectivity, functional smoothness and robustness (Lipschitz continuity).
