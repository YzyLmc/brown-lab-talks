Taylor is in his final year of a PhD program in Computer Science at University of Toronto, with standing affiliations at Vector Institute and MIT Institute of Medical Engineering and Sciences. His research broadly investigates novel applications of Reinforcement Learning to assist sequential decision making in safety-critical domains. In particular, he is interested in developing personalized decision support tools that generalize beyond the environment they were trained in, robust to sources of uncertainty such as distribution shift, covariate mismatch, and missing data. Taylor has prior degrees in Computational Science and Engineering (M.Eng, Harvard University) as well as Mathematics (B.S. Brigham Young University) that he has used in prior research positions investigating the RF scheduling algorithms, sensor placement (MIT Lincoln Laboratory), and in the modeling of fluid phenomenon (BYU R.A.).
