Reward is the driving force for reinforcement-learning agents. In this talk, I will present our recent NeurIPS paper that explores the expressivity of reward as a way to capture tasks that we would want an agent to perform. We frame this study around three new abstract notions of “task” that might be of interest: (1) a set of acceptable behaviors, (2) a partial ordering over behaviors, or (3) a partial ordering over trajectories. Our main results prove that while Markov reward can express many of these tasks, there exist instances of each task type that no Markov reward function can capture. We then provide a set of polynomial-time algorithms that construct a Markov reward function that allows an agent to optimize tasks of each of these three types, and correctly determine when no such reward function exists. I conclude by summarizing recent follow up work that studies alternatives for enriching the expressivity of reward.
