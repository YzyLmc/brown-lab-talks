Recent research at Draper has studied the role of trust in human-machine teaming. Ocular metrics using eye tracking technology have been shown to be reliable indicators of physiological measures such as fatigue, attention, and stress. However, current literature in this area lacks testing with electrooculography (EOG) technology and in dynamic environments. Using EOG glasses developed by the MIT Media Lab, we plan to improve the accuracy of certain psychophysiological measurements in dynamic environments, such as in a military context. Currently in the early stages of this new project, we are open to collaboration and developing a direction of how these measurements may be integrated with robotics to further research in other areas
