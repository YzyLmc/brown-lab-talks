In this presentation, we will provide a basic introduction of Spot, which make up two new members of our lab. This includes an overview of Spot's mechanics and hardware, off-the-shelf features, how to work with Spot and safety protocols, as well as software development. Hopefully after this talk, you will have a more concrete understanding of Spot's capabilities. This is also informative for those who don't work with robots to understand some unique challenges present in robotics.
